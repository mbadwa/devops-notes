# Python 101

This is a compilation of python scripts for learning purposes. 

1. Variables
   
   Basic variable assignments [examples](./scripts/1.%20python-101-scripts/Variables.py) and variable [lengths](./scripts/1.%20python-101-scripts/Variable%20Length%20Arguments.py)

2. Python Data Types
   
   Data types intro [here](./scripts/1.%20python-101-scripts/Dataypes.py)
3. Python Operators
   
   Find examples of python operators [here](./scripts/1.%20python-101-scripts/Operators.py)
4. Python Decision making
   
   [Here](./scripts/1.%20python-101-scripts/Conditions.py) and [here](./scripts/1.%20python-101-scripts/Condition_vars.py)are a few examples of conditional statements
5. Python Loops
   
   Here are examples of loops in Python; [loops](./scripts/1.%20python-101-scripts/Loops.py), [loops2](./scripts/1.%20python-101-scripts/Loop2.py), [break](./scripts/1.%20python-101-scripts/Break%20And%20Continue.py), [continue](./scripts/1.%20python-101-scripts/Break%20And%20Continue.py)statements.

6. Built in Methods

   [Here](./scripts/1.%20python-101-scripts/Built-in%20Methods.py) are a few examples of built in methods

7. Functions

   A few examples of functions; [functions](./scripts/1.%20python-101-scripts/Functions.py), [functions2](./scripts/1.%20python-101-scripts/Functions2.py), [modern](./scripts/1.%20python-101-scripts/modern.py). Also how to call functions one creates; [call-modern](./scripts/1.%20python-101-scripts/call-modern.py), [call-modern2](./scripts/1.%20python-101-scripts/call-modern-2.py). The other is how to use arguments in a function; [args*](./scripts/1.%20python-101-scripts/kwargs.py)


8. Python Module
   
   A module is simply a number of functions put together in a single file and then you can call each function as per need in your code.

9. All other scripts can be found [here](./scripts/1.%20python-101-scripts/).
